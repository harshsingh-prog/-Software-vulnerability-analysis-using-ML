# Vurendek: Software Vulnerability Analysis Using Machine Learning

## Project Description

Vurendek is a software vulnerability analysis tool that leverages machine learning to identify software vulnerabilities. By analyzing patterns related to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and software weakness parameters (CWEs), Vurendek aims to enhance software security measures.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Models**: Developed and implemented to identify software vulnerabilities.
- **In-Depth Analysis**: Validation of model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Data Visualization**: Designed and implemented using Matplotlib and Seaborn to present analysis findings and model performance insights.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning**: Standard Scaler, KNeighborsClassifier
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/vurendek.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd vurendek
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset of CVEs and CWEs and place it in the project directory. For example, `Vulnerability_Dataset.xlsx`.
2. Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the data:
    ```bash
    python preprocess.py
    ```
3. Train the machine learning model:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
4. Evaluate the model performance:
    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py
    ```
5. Generate visualizations to understand the data and model performance:
    ```bash
    python visualize.py
    ```

## Results

- The machine learning models effectively identify software vulnerabilities, achieving high precision, recall, and F1-scores.
- Data visualizations provide clear insights into vulnerability patterns and model performance, aiding in informed decision-making for enhancing software security.

## Code Overview

The project is structured as follows:

- **Data Preprocessing**:
    - **Loading Dataset**: The dataset is loaded using Pandas.
    - **Cleaning Data**: Irrelevant columns are dropped, and missing values are handled.
    - **Encoding**: Categorical features are encoded to numerical values for model training.
- **Model Training**:
    - **Splitting Data**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
    - **Scaling**: Features are scaled using StandardScaler.
    - **Training**: KNeighborsClassifier is used to train the model.
- **Model Evaluation**:
    - **Metrics**: Precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.
- **Data Visualization**:
    - **Distribution Plots**: Histograms, count plots, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are used to visualize the data.
